# OceanOfWeb
A sailor's delineation of the epic tales of the ocean of hyperlinks.


``` html
Oceanward I am ever yearning,
Where far it rolls in its calm and grandeur,
The weight of mountain-like fogbanks bearing,
Forever wandering and returning.

The skies may lower, the land may call it,
It knows no resting and knows no yielding.
In nights of summer, in storms of winter,
Its surges murmur the self-same longing.

                    - Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson
